## How to Run

To execute these programs, you will need to have SWI Prolog installed on your machine. You can download it from [SWI Prolog's official website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).

Once you have SWI Prolog installed, you can run the programs using the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP archive.
2. Open SWI Prolog on your computer.
3. Load the desired program file using the `consult/1` predicate. For example, to load Program 1, type the following command in the Prolog prompt:

   ```prolog
   ?- consult('PROGRAM 1  Program to add two numbers/PROGRAM 1.pl').
   ```

4. Once the program is loaded, you can run it by invoking the appropriate predicates based on the program's description.

5. Refer to the program's source code to understand its functionality and usage.

Feel free to explore and learn from these Prolog programs. Happy coding!
